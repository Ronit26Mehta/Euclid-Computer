## üìå Project Overview

**Euclid: Predictive Analytics Platform** is an advanced financial analytics and predictive modeling system designed to harness the power of modern data science techniques. Drawing inspiration from the iconic Euclid computer in the movie *Pi*, this platform is built to unravel complex market dynamics and provide actionable insights through robust forecasting models.

At its core, Euclid leverages both classical statistical methods and contemporary machine learning approaches to deliver highly accurate financial predictions. By integrating real-time data feeds with powerful visualization tools, it enables users to monitor market trends, evaluate investment opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.

Key aspects include:
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Utilizes historical and real-time data to forecast future trends.
- **Customizable Analytics**: Provides flexibility to select data sources, models, and forecast parameters.
- **User-Centric Design**: An intuitive dashboard powered by Streamlit ensures accessibility and ease-of-use.
- **Robust Architecture**: Built with a Flask-based backend that includes comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliability.

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have the correct version of Python installed.
- **Pip**: Python package installer.
- **Git**: Version control system for cloning the repository.
- **Internet Connection**: Required for fetching real-time financial data and dependencies.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and execute:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Euclid-Computer.git
cd Euclid-Computer
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Install all necessary packages using the provided `requirements.txt`:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: If you encounter any issues, consider creating a virtual environment for project isolation.*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Backend (Flask API)
Navigate to the Backend directory and start the Flask server:
```sh
cd Backend
python Euclids_backend.py
```
This will launch the REST API, which listens for incoming requests on the specified port (typically `5000`).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Frontend (Streamlit Dashboard)
Open a new terminal window, navigate to the FrontEnd directory, and run the Streamlit application:
```sh
cd ../FrontEnd
streamlit run EuclidFrontEnd.py
```
The dashboard will open in your default web browser, providing interactive access to the platform's features.

## üéØ API Endpoints

The backend exposes several REST API endpoints to facilitate communication and data retrieval:

| **Endpoint**         | **Method** | **Description**                                                      | **Example Usage**                                                   |
|----------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/api/predict`       | `POST`   | Accepts input parameters and returns financial predictions.          | `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/predict -d '{"symbol": "AAPL", "model": "ARIMA"}'` |
| `/api/data`          | `GET`    | Retrieves market data for specified assets.                          | `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/data?symbol=AAPL`                     |
| `/api/sentiment`     | `GET`    | Analyzes and returns sentiment data based on market news.            | `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/sentiment?query=Apple`                |

Each endpoint is documented with input parameters and expected output formats to simplify integration with external systems.
